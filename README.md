# Anychart_TT_Aleksandr
This project serves as a test task assigned to me by the AnyChart Team and doubles as a personal pet project.

Description:
The application is capable of fetching JSON data either from a default URL or a user-provided URL via an input field. Upon clicking the button, it initiates polling at 3000 ms intervals from the specified source. The JSON data is then parsed, and the SVG resized, with a tooltip being positioned accordingly. 

Stack:
I've used HTML, JS. Fast and simple.

Set it up:
Load the files and paste the HTML.
